         This HTML file draws the fundamental layout of the web page 
         that will be used in the bouncing balls demonstration. 
         It features a canvas tag that is to be rendered with the 
         balls later on and an h1 headline saying ‘Bouncing Balls’ 
         which is made to have a fixed background color of none and 
         white text shadow. This file has a link to an external CSS 
         file for styling and contains link to external JavaScript 
         file (main.js) for functionality. The canvas element is used 
         for rendering of the animations using the Canvas Application Programming Interface.
